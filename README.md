## Hello there üëã

Hi! I'm Rob, Lead Software Engineer @Gradle.

I've been working on the front-end side of things for more than 15 years now. My first computer was my uncle's Amstrad CPC 6128 ‚ù§Ô∏è where I spent the summers playing and programming videogames.

My work is focused on UI engineering, specially in the developer productivity and observability domains.
